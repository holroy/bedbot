# bedbot
A Minecraft Web Socket Server interacting with Discord.

## Repository goal
This repository rose out of some Discord chat related to the possibilities
available from Web Socket servers in Minecraft, and whether it was possible
to save the chat from Minecraft. After a little bit of discussion, the idea
of "storing" the chat into a Discord channel was mentioned, and also the
idea of checking for various Player events arose.

Current goal for _bedbot_ is therefore to list any chat messages it can
see to a Discord channel, and for starters also list any player related
events like join, leave or being killed. In due time it _might_ also allow
for messages to be sent back to Minecraft, and some commands related to
handling the bot and/or the connections.

## Building blocks
To get the show running a lot of googling occurred, and a choice of which
modules/libraries to use was made. These will be listed here another day.
